##  Who am I?

Hi, my name is Shawn Campbell. I work at <a href="http://www.cashstar.com/">CashStar, Inc</a> as a Sr. Software Engineer.
I mainly work in python and javascript but lately I've been writing almost 100% in go. I've been programming professionally
for over 15 years and have worked in Python, Ruby, Go, Groovy, Java, C#, C/C++, Objective-C and JavaScript.
