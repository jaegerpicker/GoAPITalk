##  Go the language in a short list

- A simple language. Most developers can learn go in a day or two. It's a very limited scope of learning
- Statically Typed but very much the productivity of a dynamic language thanks to type inference
- Compiles to native machine code (There is a tiny embedded vm in the executable) so it's REALLY fast and efficient
- Concurrency is built into the language level (go and channels) and it does an amazing job at avoiding callback hell
- Incredibly great "batteries included" standard lib. Nearly everything you need is included
- Extermely fast compile/test cycles which increases developer speed
- Unit testing built into the language at a core level

To me it feels very much like python but MUCH faster and safer to develop in.
