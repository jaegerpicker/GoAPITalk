##  Ok at least lets speed things up

Three popular paths to speeding up your API and some issues relating to them:

- Java (JVM based language)
    - This is a heavy vm and deployment is a pretty bring pain. Plus the language itself is less productive then many other choices. Very "Enterprisy" and the cpu/ram usage is still not great
- C/C++
    - Very dangerous, difficult to write secure software, way fewer web focused frameworks/libs, kinda sorta typed but not really
- C# (dot net)
    - Tyes you to the Microsoft platform, You miss out on a ton of open source packages, forces you to develop in a windows environment

Like all tech everything has trade offs, for the above reasons none of these seem like great solutions to me.
