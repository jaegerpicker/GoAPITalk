##  Go the language in a short list

- A simple language. Most developers can learn go in a day or two. It's a very limited scope of learning
- Statically Typed but very much the productivy of a dynamic language thanks to type inferance
- Compiles to native machine code (There is a tiny imbedded vm in the executable) so it's REALLY fast and effiecent
- Concurrency is built into the language level (go and channels) and it does an amazing job at avoid callback hell
- Incredibly great "batteries included" standard lib. Nearly everything you need is included
- Extermely fast compile/test cylces which increases developer speed
- Unit testing built into the language at a core level

To me it feels very much like python but MUCH faster and safer to develop in.
